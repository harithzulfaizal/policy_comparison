Without the actual content of the overview, it's difficult to assess the specific impact, but generally, an overview aims to provide context, summarize key elements, and establish the document's purpose.",

    "difference": "The primary difference lies in the expanded scope of e-KYC to include both individuals and legal persons in Version 2, while Version 1 focuses solely on individuals. Additionally, Version 2 emphasizes the need for enhancements to existing requirements due to the growing adoption of e-KYC solutions. Version 2 also added Bank Negara Malaysia as the bank's official name and added countering proliferation financing (CPF) in point (iii).",
    "impact": "The impact of these changes is significant. By including legal persons, Version 2 broadens the applicability of the policy, potentially affecting a wider range of financial transactions and customer relationships. The emphasis on enhancements suggests a proactive approach to adapting to evolving technological advancements and risks associated with e-KYC. The policy also now ensures effective anti-money laundering, countering financing of terrorism and countering proliferation financing (AML/CFT/CPF) control measures.",

Additionally, the reference footnote for CDD in the e-KYC definition is updated from [1] to [2]. The definitions of “False Positive” and “False Negative” are swapped in version 2 compared to version 1. Furthermore, “False Negative” and “False Positive” definitions include the word falsely instead of wrongly in version 2 compared to version 1.

Including designated payment instruments in the 'customer' definition broadens the policy's applicability.

The staggered audit schedule provides some flexibility while still ensuring consistent monitoring. The notification requirement when the FAR exceeds 5% for three months within a six-month period ensures prompt regulatory oversight and corrective action. The proposed actions to reduce FAR and mitigating actions indicates expectation to enhance monitoring and controls. The explicit inclusion of AI solutions acknowledges their expected improved performance with more data. Overall, this section aims to balance innovation in e-KYC with robust risk management and regulatory compliance.

    "impact": "This section outlines specific e-KYC (electronic Know Your Customer) safeguards that financial institutions must implement when offering certain higher-risk financial products (current accounts, savings accounts, and unrestricted investment accounts) through electronic channels. The impact of this section is primarily on enhancing customer identification and verification processes to mitigate fraud and money laundering risks associated with remote onboarding. By mandating biometric verification against government-issued IDs, authenticating the IDs, ensuring liveness detection, and requiring proof of an existing bank account with another licensed institution, the regulation aims to increase the security and reliability of e-KYC procedures. This will likely increase the cost and complexity of implementing e-KYC for financial institutions, but will reduce risks. It may also present challenges for customers who do not have existing bank accounts or government issued IDs or are not technologically savvy. The regulation also reinforces the importance of data consistency across different financial institutions, requiring verification of customer details with existing accounts.",

Firstly, it creates a benchmark for e-KYC solution effectiveness, enabling regulators and institutions to assess the accuracy and reliability of these technologies. The specific metrics required, such as True Positives, False Negatives, False Acceptance Rate, and False Rejection Rate, provide a granular view of performance. Secondly, the breakdown by document type (MyKad, Passport, etc.) and e-KYC check type (document authenticity, biometric matching) allows for targeted analysis and improvement. This level of detail can help identify specific vulnerabilities or biases within the e-KYC process. Thirdly, the mandatory reporting requirement promotes transparency and accountability, potentially driving innovation and competition among e-KYC solution providers. However, the increased data collection and reporting burden may present challenges for smaller financial institutions with limited resources.",

The primary impact lies in increasing transparency and accountability in the e-KYC process within financial institutions. By mandating the reporting of average completion times for application, account opening, and account activation, the policy aims to encourage efficiency and identify potential bottlenecks in the system. This data can be used by regulators to benchmark performance across different institutions and identify areas needing improvement. Further, the requirement to submit detailed information on the e-KYC solution's features, risk assessments, and process flows allows for a comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness and security. By ensuring that financial institutions report on their compliance with related policies like RMiT and Outsourcing, the policy aims to integrate e-KYC within the broader regulatory framework.

However, we can infer that this section is designed to provide guidance on how to properly submit information or materials related to the policy. A well-written and clear 'Submission instructions' section would likely increase compliance with the policy and reduce errors or delays in the submission process. Conversely, poorly written or unclear instructions could lead to confusion, non-compliance, and increased administrative burden. The impact would depend on factors such as the target audience's familiarity with the submission process, the complexity of the required information, and the clarity and accessibility of the instructions themselves. Without the actual submission instructions, it is hard to provide a more refined answer, but the goal is to provide guidance to stakeholders on how to submit information for compliance and monitoring.",
